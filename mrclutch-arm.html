		<h1>MR-Clutch Robotic Arm - Professor Kermani</h1>
		<p>This is a project designed for making a low cost, high power MR-Clutch
		joint controller. The microcontroller used is an STM32F103, using FreeRTOS
		for the operating system for the controller. The electrical design is made
		in KiCad for a few reasons, the biggest one is the ability to break up the
		schematic into multiple smaller ones which are used internally. This allows
		for more collaboration between the members of the lab.</p>
		<p>Here I created a environment for compiling ARM on linux. Made a small portion
		of the libc in arm assembly. Generated a proper link file for different stms
		and properly flashing. Implemented CAN networking on both the STM and Jetson TX2,
		and designed a protocol for CAN communication between the board and STM.</p>
		<p>This is open source on the gitea I set up on Professor Kermani's server.</p>
