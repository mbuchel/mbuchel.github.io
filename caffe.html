		<h1>Caffe GUI</h1>
		<p>This project is to simplify the development of Neural Networks built
		using Caffe. The current design will be similar to other CAD software
		for engineers. The language of choice originally was Racket, however due
		to some input from a close friend of mine. I decided to learn NIM and
		make this in NIM. Once the proof of concept is finished I will create
		an open source repo for people to contribute to it if they so desire it.
		The reason I am using NIM and was debating Racket is simply due to their
		meta-programming abilities and easy to define DSL (Domain Specific Language).
		This is heavily useful for simplifying the code required to write the
		Caffe output.</p>
