The Doom port is Chocolate Doom, and I used it as an experience to figure out how to code for the STM32 this way. STM32 is a 32 bit ARM CPU specifically designed for embedded systems. I had to work with the STM32 for the MR-Clutch arm robot, where it was supposed to act as the controller for the arm, and the Jetson TX2 was the brain of the system.</div><div class="post-list-footer text-center"><a href=https://mbuchel.github.io/knowledge/stm/>Read More</a></div></div><li><div class=post-list-item><div class=post-header><h4 class=post-link><a href=https://mbuchel.github.io/knowledge/qt-vs-gtk/>QT vs GTK</a></h4><h4 class=post-date>Aug 10, 2019</h4></div><div class=post-summary><p>Background Knowledge: There are many frameworks and graphics toolkits for cross platform development. The main 2 that are used by linux users are GTK and QT. I personally prefer QT, however I will explain how to use GTK as well in this post. The fundamental difference between the 2 is that QT is it&rsquo;s own framework, and has a specific build system for QT applications (a particular engineer I know also used that build system to program STM32 controllers).</div><div class="post-list-footer text-center"><a href=https://mbuchel.github.io/knowledge/qt-vs-gtk/>Read More</a></div></div><li><div class=post-list-item><div class=post-header><h4 class=post-link><a href=https://mbuchel.github.io/knowledge/compression/>Compression</a></h4><h4 class=post-date>Aug 10, 2019</h4></div><div class=post-summary><p>Background Knowledge: Compression is one of the key outcomes of information theory, which should be studied by every single engineer regardless the area of engineering they are in. Without compression we create systems which use unnecessary data.
Quick Run: Compression has many different subfields in it, I will only talk about a few that I have become aqquinted with.
Huffman Encoding: This is one of the simplest compression schemes. Unfortunately, this is poor for dynamically changing sources of information.</div><div class="post-list-footer text-center"><a href=https://mbuchel.github.io/knowledge/compression/>Read More</a></div></div><li><div class=post-list-item><div class=post-header><h4 class=post-link><a href=https://mbuchel.github.io/knowledge/sensors/>Sensors</a></h4><h4 class=post-date>Aug 10, 2019</h4></div><div class=post-summary><p>Background Knowledge: Most of my work in sensors, has been in designing biofeedback wearable devices, such as WearME Brace. While I also have experience in other sensor systems, such as cameras and hall effect sensors, this post will be a quick rundown of all the specifics needed in order to make a reliable sensor system.
Quick Run: The first thing to know for sensor design is: what are you trying to achieve?</div><div class="post-list-footer text-center"><a href=https://mbuchel.github.io/knowledge/sensors/>Read More</a></div></div><li><div class=post-list-item><div class=post-header><h4 class=post-link><a href=https://mbuchel.github.io/knowledge/communications-protocols/>Communications Protocols</a></h4><h4 class=post-date>Aug 10, 2019</h4></div><div class=post-summary><p>Background Knowledge: All connected devices require a communication protocol of one kind or another in order to inform the other device of what task it should perform next. Or as to the result of the task the device has performed. Now there are plenty of hardware based approaches I have worked on, and several more software based ones. Due to the vast magnitude I will just briefly touch upon some of them, feel free to contact me if you want a more indepth explanation of how the different protocols work.</div><div class="post-list-footer text-center"><a href=https://mbuchel.github.io/knowledge/communications-protocols/>Read More</a></div></div><li><div class=post-list-item><div class=post-header><h4 class=post-link><a href=https://mbuchel.github.io/knowledge/power-control/>Power Control</a></h4><h4 class=post-date>Aug 10, 2019</h4></div><div class=post-summary><p>Background Knowledge: All electrical systems require a proper power management system. My main experience with power management has been in the battery management field as well as wireless harvesting. However due to practicality issues involved with wireless harvesting the purpose of this post will be focused on battery power management, as well as power supply management.
Quick Run: There are plenty of circuits for controlling the charge a lithium ion battery gets.</div><div class="post-list-footer text-center"><a href=https://mbuchel.github.io/knowledge/power-control/>Read More</a></div></div><li><div class=post-list-item><div class=post-header><h4 class=post-link><a href=https://mbuchel.github.io/knowledge/motor-control/>Motor Control</a></h4><h4 class=post-date>Aug 10, 2019</h4></div><div class=post-summary><p>Background Knowledge: The first half of the picture is called a 3 phase inverter circuit, while the second half is the actual motor. These type of setups are common in AC motor control, I will ignore DC control schemes for motors are they are for the most part straightforward and do not have different kinds of control schemes which is common in AC motor systems.
Quick Run: AC motors are playing a bigger role than ever in our ever increasingly automated world, due to the reduced cost and power consumption.</div><div class="post-list-footer text-center"><a href=https://mbuchel.github.io/knowledge/motor-control/>Read More</a></div></div></ul><div class="pagination-wrapper text-center"><ul class=pagination><li><a href=/knowledge/ aria-label=First><span aria-hidden=true>&laquo;&laquo;</span></a><li><a href=/knowledge/ aria-label=Previous><span aria-hidden=true>&laquo;</span></a><li><a href=/knowledge/>1</a><li class=active><a href=/knowledge/page/2/>2</a><li class=disabled><a href aria-label=Next><span aria-hidden=true>&raquo;</span></a><li><a href=/knowledge/page/2/ aria-label=Last><span aria-hidden=true>&raquo;&raquo;</span></a></ul></div><div class=push></div></div><footer class="footer text-center"><p>Copyright &copy; 2019 Michael Buchel -
