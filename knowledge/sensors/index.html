wearable devices, such as WearME Brace. While I also have experience
in other sensor systems, such as cameras and hall effect sensors,
this post will be a quick rundown of all the specifics needed in
order to make a reliable sensor system.<h1 id=quick-run>Quick Run:</h1><p>The first thing to know for sensor design is: what are you trying
to achieve? From here we can determine what kind of system we are
trying to design. An example is say I just want a raw value that
comes in GPS is a perfect example here. A GPS value is just a string
that comes from a satellite, in this case the system is pretty clear
cut and simple to implement. Now we just take these values and calculate
the distance to the satellites, thereby getting the location. Now
thankfully most GPS modules do this for you so you do not have to
worry about synchronization issues, and detecting the distance.
As most sane people use modules and do not make them from scratch.<p>Now not all modules are as simple to use as GPS where all you need
to do is just simple text parsing. In quite a few cases it is required
to have protection, or signal processing before the signal gets into
the MCU. A good example here is an EMG sensor, these sensors are nothing
more than electrodes. For this reason it is necessary to ensure that
they do not electrocute the individual wearing them. This is done using
with Electro Static Discharge (ESD) protection. This and the model to use
typically are given in the datasheet, below is an image of a typical
ESD protection circuit.<p><img src=/esd-protection.png alt="ESD Protection Circuit"><p>Now to put into perspective here is an image of the sensor circuit that
was designed for the WearME Brace.<p><img src=/sensors-wearme.png alt="Sensors board WearME"><p>This board is not the finished board, as the finished one was smaller and
more compact. However you can see from here the protection circuit.<p>Now the bigger problem is one of calibration, each sensor is a different
form of calibration. When working at Mycionics camera calibration took
3-4 months before we automated it fully. It is mandatory to ensure a decent
calibration otherwise all the work you do will be imaginary, and easily
changed based on the environment.<h1 id=most-important-tidbits>Most Important Tidbits:</h1><ul><li>MEASURE YOUR ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS ESPECIALLY SENSORS<li>Calibration is incredibly important<li>There are ways to use capacitance in between 2 board layers in order to measure touch, this was an incredibly interesting conversation I had<li>Use feedback loops to ensure you are getting the correct data</ul></div><div class=post-comments></div><div class=push></div></div><footer class="footer text-center"><p>Copyright &copy; 2019 Michael Buchel -
