<h3>Segnet Project <small>2/1/2019</small></h3>
<img class="thumbnail" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CxanE_W46ts/hqdefault.jpg">
<p>I have implemented my own version of Segnet (which is a neural network for
semantic segmentation of images) for the purpose of identifying objects in a
lab. So far this is still in the prototype stage as I have been focusing on
evaluating the speed specifically of using a convolutional neural network vs
a recurrent neural network for the process of image identification. Further
plans to add in Hidden Markov Models for the purpose to see if that is a faster
way of doing things. The primary way of doing this so far has been using Caffe
and C++, this has taught me a lot of the shortcomings in current technology
for current machine learning, and inspired me to create a GUI for Caffe neural
network design for simplifying the design process.</p>
<p>Since this is still not fully finished it is not Open Source, there are plans
of making this open source once I finish. This likely will be hosted on the Gitea
I set up for the professor I am making this for.</p>

<h3>Caffe Project <small>2/1/2019</small></h3>
<img class="thumbnail" src="https://coqube.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/caffe-logo-300x129.jpg">
<p>This project is to simplify the development of Neural Networks built
using Caffe. The current design will be similar to other CAD software
for engineers. The language of choice originally was Racket, however due
to some input from a close friend of mine. I decided to learn NIM and
make this in NIM. Once the proof of concept is finished I will create
an open source repo for people to contribute to it if they so desire it.
The reason I am using NIM and was debating Racket is simply due to their
meta-programming abilities and easy to define DSL (Domain Specific Language).
This is heavily useful for simplifying the code required to write the
Caffe output.</p>

<h3>Natural Language Processing Project <small>2/1/2019</small></h3>
<img class="thumbnail" src="https://www.expertsystem.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Natural-Language-Processing-Definition-1.jpg">
<p>For fun I made several recurrent neural networks for analysis of
text to see if I can generate words from the trained neural network,
the best result was using a recurrent neural network. There were other
cases where I made a tagging system for words in a message to try to
determine the meaning of the sentence using a goal tree approach. From
here I learned how to properly use boosting and different drawbacks
from neural networks. Hidden Markov Models were the best choice for
the tagging system for parts of speech, they where however poor at
creating paragraphs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this was mostly done for closed source programs, which
makes it impossible to open source most of these programs.</p>

<h3>Facial Recognition Project <small>2/1/2019</small></h3>
<img class="thumbnail" src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kqYut0P9XnKSwo-bek1kbsyQf4c=/768x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-822981362_JohnLund-59f9441c9abed50010a3b267.jpg">
<p>This was originally done as a prototype for a business feasibility
project. Unfortunately it was not used for the report, it gave me quite
a bit of experience with building computer vision algorithms and using
opencv. This was using LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) as from
testing it gave the smoothest recognition.</p>
<p>This was originally designed for the purpose of training the AI for
identifying people who enter the house, this can be used for insurance
purposes as well as accountability. This would have been installed by
the landlord to ensure there are no infraction to the lease agreement.
This can move to do more than just tracking faces by making a bigger
model we are fitting with LBPH.</p>
<p>This is open source however it is poorly implemented.</p>
