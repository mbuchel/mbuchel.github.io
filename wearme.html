		<h1>WearME Project - Professor Trejos</h1>
		<p>Worked on creating a wearable brace for musculoskeletal rehabilitation,
		for professor Trejos. This was split up into 4 board areas, the first is
		motor control, second is power, third is communication, fourth is sensor
		input. All of these use uart for internal board to board communication,
		I also developed both arithmetic encoding and LMZ encoding schemes for the
		compression schemes of the data. I was able to hit a 2.0 compression rate
		which is the theoritical maximum for loseless compression.</p>
		<p>From here I learned a habit I had was not good for development and started
		working on fixing this by modularizing my work and testing smaller sections
		instead of larger sections.</p>
		<p>This is not open source unfortunately.</p>
