<h3>MR-Clutch Robotic Arm - Professor Kermani <small>2/1/2019</small></h3>
<img class="thumbnail" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yBIslVMb3OU/hqdefault.jpg">
<p>This is a project designed for making a low cost, high power MR-Clutch
joint controller. The agricultural used is an STM32F103, using FreeRTOS
for the operating system for the controller. The electrical design is made
in KiCad for a few reasons, the biggest one is the ability to break up the
schematic into multiple smaller ones which are used internally. This allows
for more collaboration between the members of the lab.</p>
<p>Here I created a environment for compiling ARM on Linux. Made a small portion
of the libc in arm assembly. Generated a proper link file for different STM
and properly flashing. Implemented CAN networking on both the STM and Jetson TX2,
and designed a protocol for CAN communication between the board and STM.</p>
<p>This is open source on the gitea I set up on Professor Kermani's server.</p>

<h3>Mushroom Project - Professor Kermani/Mycionics <small>2/1/2019</small></h3>
<img class="thumbnail" src="https://uploads.trifectanutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/02222714/Portobello-Mushroom.png">
<p>Worked on this project for over a year, created the base for an autonomous
mushroom picking robot for industrial use. Tested this and helped secure funding
from IRAP for the company/project. Developed the vision system, the communication
system, the logging system. Developed the base for a wireless network for the
harvester to interact with the other robots in the farm. Worked on developing a
port of FreeRTOS to the Jetson TX2, and created the build system. Further acted
as a sysadmin for a while on this project.</p>

<h3>WearME Project - Professor Trejos <small>2/1/2019</small></h3>
<img class="thumbnail" src="https://www.eng.uwo.ca/electrical/research/labs/wbml/img/projects/brace1.jpg">
<p>Worked on creating a wearable brace for musculoskeletal rehabilitation,
for professor Trejos. This was split up into 4 board areas, the first is
motor control, second is power, third is communication, fourth is sensor
input. All of these use UART for internal board to board communication,
I also developed both arithmetic encoding and LMZ encoding schemes for the
compression schemes of the data. I was able to hit a 2.0 compression rate
which is the theoretical maximum for lose-less compression.</p>
<p>From here I learned a habit I had was not good for development and started
working on fixing this by modularizing my work and testing smaller sections
instead of larger sections.</p>
<p>This is not open source unfortunately.</p>
