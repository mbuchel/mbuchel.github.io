sense that our low level jobs are replaced by automated
machine which in turn can handle menial tasks such
as picking mushrooms. This was done under the supervision
of Dr. Kermani at Western University, as research for
the company Mycionics Incorporated.<h1 id=details-of-work>Details of Work:</h1><p>I performed quite a few tasks for this work, from computer
vision algorithm development, to mobile app/server development.
A few of the main areas I worked on during this employement are
as follows:<ul><li><a href=/knowledge/build-systems>Build System</a><li><a href=/knowledge/camera-calibration>Camera Calibration</a><li><a href=/knowledge/android-programming>Android Coding</a><li><a href=/knowledge/communications-protocols>Communication Protocols</a><li><a href=/knowledge/server-api-design>Server API Design</a><li><a href=/knowledge/hmm-vs-cnn-vs-rnn>Machine Learning</a><li><a href=/knowledge/real-time>Real Time Systems</a><li><a href=/knowledge/model-fitting>Model fitting</a><li><a href=/knowledge/superquadratics>Superquadratics</a><li><a href=/knowledge/jetson>Jetson</a></ul><p>I have also worked on compression algorithms which are both
further discussed <a href=/knowledge/compression>here</a>.<p>My main task here was to improve the original algorithm as well
as develop a base system from which to work forward on (architect
role). During my employement we made several jumps in programming
paradigms, the first being from imperative to an object oriented
system, this was to allow for minimizing the development and debugging
time. Another reason for this was object oriented C++ compiled using
g++, tends to compile to more effective code thereby increasing
speed. I have also made a server from scratch using functional
programming paradigms (to prevent malicious altering of data).
Unfortunately due to me being the only engineer who know functional
programming, this was changed to an imperative/object oriented
style with certain functional aspects.<p>I have also developed a GUI application, explanation <a href=/knowledge/qt-vs-gtk>here</a>.<h1 id=lessons-learned>Lessons Learned:</h1><p>Over this time, I learned how to handle a large workflow,
develop a plan for delivery of projects, debug several thousand
line programs, proper logging tools, as well as building a base
for projects to follow.<h1 id=details-of-employment>Details of Employment:</h1><p>Febuary 2017-September 2018, Work-Studies.<h1 id=code-hardware>Code/Hardware:</h1><p>This is not open source unfortunately.</div><div class=post-comments></div><div class=push></div></div><footer class="footer text-center"><p>Copyright &copy; 2019 Michael Buchel -
