		<h1>Segnet</h1>
		<p>I have implemented my own version of Segnet (which is a neural network for
		semantic segmentation of images) for the purpose of identifying objects in a
		lab. So far this is still in the prototype stage as I have been focusing on
		evaluating the speed specifically of using a convolutional neural network vs
		a recurrent neural network for the process of image identification. Further
		plans to add in Hidden Markov Models for the purpose to see if that is a faster
		way of doing things. The primary way of doing this so far has been using Caffe
		and C++, this has taught me a lot of the shortcomings in current technology
		for current machine learning, and inspired me to create a GUI for Caffe neural
		network design for simplifying the design process.</p>
		<p>Since this is still not fully finished it is not Open Source, there are plans
		of making this open source once I finish. This likely will be hosted on the Gitea
		I set up for the professor I am making this for.</p>
