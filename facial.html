		<h1>Facial Recognition Program</h1>
		<p>This was originally done as a prototype for a business feasibility
		project. Unfortunately it was not used for the report, it gave me quite
		a bit of experience with building computer vision algorithms and using
		opencv. This was using LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) as from
		testing it gave the smoothest recognition.</p>
		<p>This was originally designed for the purpose of training the AI for
		identifying people who enter the house, this can be used for insurance
		purposes as well as accountability. This would have been installed by
		the landlord to ensure there are no infraction to the lease agreement.
		This can move to do more than just tracking faces by making a bigger
		model we are fitting with LBPH.</p>
		<p>This is open source however it is poorly implemented.</p>
