		<h1>Natural Language Processing</h1>
		<p>For fun I made several recurrent neural networks for analysis of
		text to see if I can generate words from the trained neural network,
		the best result was using a recurrent neural network. There were other
		cases where I made a tagging system for words in a message to try to
		determine the meaning of the sentence using a goal tree approach. From
		here I learned how to properly use boosting and different drawbacks
		fron neural networks. Hidden Markov Models were the best choice for
		the tagging system for parts of speech, they where however poor at
		creating paragraphs.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately this was mostly done for closed source programs, which
		makes it impossible to open source most of these programs.</p>
