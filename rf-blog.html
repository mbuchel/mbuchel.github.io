<p>Currently the Capstone project is the largest project I am working on.
This is the end of the engineering degree project for Engineers at my university.
My capstone project is the identification of individuals using wireless
waves or microwave radar waves to be more precise. The inspiration came from
originally viewing Dina Katabi's WiTrack technology. This further got us looking
into other groups that made similar things and discovered HackRF on github.</p>
<p>From this project I have learned how to make a proper RF design for an arbitrary
purpose. The use of Ferrite beads for filtering of a power supply for a smoother
supply input. The proper use of mixers and PLLs. And finally a better understanding
of how to design antennas.</p>
<p>For this project I took the role of the system designer focusing first on
the creation of the block diagram of the circuit as well as the design and code
of the project, unfortunately for now at least this whole system is closed source
and there are no plans of making this open source in the near future.</p>
